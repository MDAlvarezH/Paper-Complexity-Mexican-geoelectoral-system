# Paper-Complexity-Mexican-geoelectoral-system

### Abstract

In order to determine the complexity of the Mexican geoelectoral
system, this research analyzes the factors that influence the
processes of integration, maintenance and updating of the Federal Register
of Voters. The analysis starts from a heuristic definition of the
concept of electoral complexity to build a group of indexes and a stratification
that will allow quantifying the complexity of the basic units
of the Mexican geo-electoral system based on information from various
statistical indicators.
